# SchedulingApplication
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, REST Api employee scheduling web application.

This is a post-bootcamp side project that I am building to help keep my my skills expanding.

It is a Scheduling Application that features:
- Employee CRUD functions
- Shift CRUD functions
- Homemade, scrollable weekly calendar
- Search for shifts by date
- Navigate schedules by week or by day

Still to come: 
- Introduce Steams into my REST Api and replace old methods with them
- Hashed password/login screen
- Statistics view, which will give a visual representation of data
- Template schedule function (create a template schedule for easy copy/paste)
